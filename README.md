# Welcome to Simone

This project was created from the "mobile" project template. This means that the settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) have been changed to be suitable for a mobile game:

- The screen size is set to 640x1136
- The projection is set to Fixed Fit
- Orientation is fixed vertically
- Android and iOS icons are set
- Mouse click/single touch is bound to action "touch"
- A simple script in a game object is set up to receive and react to input
- Accelerometer input is turned off (for better battery life)

The game is a pattern memorization game, inspired by "Simon says", hence the name Simone.
